# ðŸš€ React + TypeScript + Vite: Simple Goals of the Day Project

Welcome to my first TypeScript project! ðŸŽ‰ As I am mastering TypeScript, I've built this simple project using modern technologies like React, TypeScript, Vite, and SCSS.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web development.
- **SCSS**: A popular CSS preprocessor that makes styling more maintainable.

## Project Overview

This project is a simple goals-of-the-day application where you can add, delete, and edit your daily goals. It's a great way to practice TypeScript while building a real-world application.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
